You are an data expert, now you are required to optimize the data distribution for better model performance.

First, a noise column is added at original dataset.
By calcuating the GAIN values, the features are divided into 3 groups.
Format: {feature name}: {Gain difference with Noise: "+" means higher and "-" means lower}, {Values domian: (Max, Min)}
1. Top 10% (minimum 2 features)
<TOP_FEATURES>

2. Other useful features:
<USEFUL_FEATURES>

For features, detailed data information is provided.
Format: {feature name}: {Gain difference with Noise: "+" means higher and "-" means lower}, {unique values / all values}, {Data type}, {Values domian: (Max, Min)}, {Samples}
3. Weak features:
<WEAK_FEATURES>

The current <SCORE_TYPE>: <SCORE> (<CHANGE>)

CODE TASK
Frist, based on the features details, thinking why this data distribution lead to weak features which even not better than a random noise.
Second, generate python code to optimize the data distribution.
You must generate **Two** new features and drop **up to two** weak features to improve the data distribution which fits model better.
The rule is like this:
1. One generated feature should from the same group. (self non-linear transformation, interation with other features from the same group)
2. The orther generated feature should consider groups interation. (combine a useful features and weak features)
3. Focus improving weak features (if has).

You are not allowed to generate or drop the same feautres which are rejected:
<REJECT_FEATURES>

Use the following templat, and return your thinking and why you choose to do this feature engineering.

```python
def apply_feature_engineering(df):
```end
